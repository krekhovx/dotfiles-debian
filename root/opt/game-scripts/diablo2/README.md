## Diablo II
This script is created to simplify the installation and launch of Diablo II. It
downloads necessary open and proprietary files and automates the process of
preparing the game for launch on Debian. Diablo II installed through ./play.it
relies on Wine, as we have not found a native engine providing a playable
experience yet.

## Installation

- Before installation, make sure that your machine has internet access.

- Run the installation script:
```
$ ./install.sh
```

- Enjoy the game:
```
$ diablo-2
```

## Where are the game files stored?
```
~/.local/share/games/diablo-2/
```
